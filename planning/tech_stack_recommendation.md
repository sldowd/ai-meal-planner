# Technical Stack Recommendation
## AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application

### Executive Summary
This document outlines the recommended technology stack for the AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application. The recommendations are tailored to support both the initial CLI-based MVP and future web and mobile expansions, with a focus on leveraging Python's robust ecosystem for AI/ML capabilities.

### Core Technology Stack

#### Programming Language
**Python 3.10+** is recommended as the primary programming language for this project due to:
- Strong support for AI/ML libraries and frameworks
- Extensive package ecosystem
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Suitable for both CLI and web applications (via frameworks)
- Your existing familiarity as a computer science student

#### Database
**SQLite** is recommended for the MVP phase:
- Embedded database requiring no separate server
- Zero configuration required
- File-based storage for simple deployment
- Sufficient for single-user local application
- Python support via built-in `sqlite3` module

For the future web-based version, migration to **PostgreSQL** is recommended:
- Robust, enterprise-grade relational database
- Excellent support for JSON data types (helpful for storing recipe data)
- Strong scalability characteristics
- Well-supported by Python ORM libraries

#### Database Interface
**SQLAlchemy** ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):
- Abstracts database operations into Python objects
- Simplifies future database migrations
- Provides a consistent API regardless of the underlying database
- Enables a cleaner separation of concerns in the codebase

#### AI/ML Components

**Natural Language Processing:**
- **spaCy**: For parsing and understanding recipe instructions and ingredients
- **NLTK**: For text classification and processing of user inputs

**Recommendation System:**
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing basic recommendation algorithms
- **Surprise**: A Python scikit for building recommendation systems
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (optional): For more advanced deep learning models if needed

**LLM Integration Options:**
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **OpenAI API** or **Hugging Face Transformers**: For accessing pre-trained models

#### CLI Framework
**Typer** or **Click**:
- Modern, decorator-based CLI creation
- Automatic help page generation
- Input validation and type annotations
- Rich formatting capabilities

#### Data Processing
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management

#### Testing
- **pytest**: Modern Python testing framework
- **coverage.py**: For measuring code coverage
- **Hypothesis**: For property-based testing

### Development Tools

#### Version Control
- **Git**: For source code management
- **GitHub** or **GitLab**: For repository hosting and collaboration

#### Development Environment
- **Visual Studio Code** or **PyCharm**: IDE with Python support
- **Poetry** or **Pipenv**: For dependency management
- **pre-commit**: For automated code quality checks

#### Documentation
- **Sphinx**: For generating code documentation
- **MkDocs**: For project documentation
- **Docstrings**: For in-code documentation

### Future Expansion Technologies

#### Web Application (Phase 2)
- **FastAPI** or **Flask**: Python web frameworks
- **SQLAlchemy**: Continued use for database operations
- **Alembic**: For database migrations
- **Pydantic**: For data validation
- **React** or **Vue.js**: For frontend development

#### Mobile Applications (Phase 3)
- **React Native**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **REST API**: Built with FastAPI to serve as backend
- **Firebase**: Optional for authentication and cloud functions

#### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Docker**: For containerization
- **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**: For cloud hosting
- **PostgreSQL**: Cloud-hosted database

### Architecture Recommendations

#### MVP Architecture (CLI Application)
1. **Layered Architecture**:
   - Presentation Layer (CLI interface)
   - Application Layer (Business logic)
   - Domain Layer (Core entities and logic)
   - Data Access Layer (Database operations)

2. **Component Separation**:
   - User Profile Management
   - Recipe Data Management
   - Meal Planning Engine
   - AI Recommendation System
   - Database Interaction

#### Future Web Architecture
1. **API-First Approach**:
   - RESTful API design
   - Separation of frontend and backend
   - Stateless authentication

2. **Containerized Deployment**:
   - Microservices architecture
   - Docker containers
   - CI/CD pipeline

### Implementation Roadmap

1. Set up development environment with Python and dependencies
2. Implement database schema with SQLite and SQLAlchemy
3. Develop user profile management system
4. Create basic recipe and meal plan data structures
5. Implement AI recommendation algorithms
6. Develop CLI interface with Typer or Click
7. Add data persistence and retrieval functionality
8. Implement comprehensive testing
9. Document codebase and features

#### Phase 2: Web Application Migration
1. Design RESTful API with FastAPI
2. Migrate database to PostgreSQL
3. Implement user authentication
4. Develop frontend with React/Vue.js
5. Set up cloud infrastructure
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline

#### Phase 3: Mobile Application Development
1. Design mobile UI/UX
2. Develop React Native application
3. Integrate with existing backend API
4. Implement offline capabilities
5. Set up app distribution

### Conclusion
The recommended stack leverages Python's strengths in AI/ML while providing a clear path for future expansion. Starting with a CLI-based MVP using SQLite will allow for rapid development and testing of the core functionality, while the selected technologies provide a smooth transition path to web and mobile platforms.

This technical stack balances your educational goals as a computer science student with practical implementation concerns, focusing on technologies that will enhance your portfolio while delivering a functional application.
