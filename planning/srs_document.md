# Software Requirements Specification
## AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application. This application will generate personalized weekly meal plans and recipes based on user preferences and constraints.

#### 1.2 Scope
The AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application will allow users to create profiles with dietary preferences and constraints, and receive AI-generated meal plans and recipes tailored to their specifications. The MVP will be a CLI application with local data persistence, with future plans to expand to web and mobile platforms.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product
- **CLI**: Command Line Interface
- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence
- **ML**: Machine Learning
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **UI**: User Interface
- **DB**: Database

### 2. Overall Description
