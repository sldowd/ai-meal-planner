# Testing Strategy
## AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application

### Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application. It defines the testing approach, methodologies, tools, and processes that will be used to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the application throughout its development lifecycle. The strategy covers both the MVP CLI application and provides a foundation for testing future web and mobile extensions.

### Testing Objectives

1. Validate that the application meets all functional requirements
2. Ensure the application handles edge cases and error conditions gracefully
3. Verify data integrity and persistence
4. Assess the quality of AI recommendations against user preferences
5. Confirm system performance meets acceptable thresholds
6. Validate the usability of the CLI interface
7. Establish a foundation for testing future platform migrations

### Testing Levels

#### Unit Testing

**Purpose:** Verify the correctness of individual components in isolation

**Scope:**
- Domain model classes and methods
- Service layer components
- Repository implementations
- Utility functions
- AI recommendation algorithms (component level)

**Approach:**
- Test-driven development (TDD) where possible
- Each class should have a corresponding test class
- Mock external dependencies and database access
- Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

**Tools:**
- pytest as the primary testing framework
- pytest-mock for mocking dependencies
- coverage.py for tracking test coverage

**Example Test Cases:**
- User profile validation rejects invalid dietary preferences
- Recipe scaling correctly adjusts ingredient quantities
- Meal plan generation respects dietary restrictions
- Repository operations correctly persist and retrieve data

#### Integration Testing

**Purpose:** Verify that components work together correctly

**Scope:**
- Database interactions with the ORM
- Service layer interaction with repositories
- AI recommendations with preference matching
- CLI commands with application services

**Approach:**
- Test components in pairs or small groups
- Use test databases rather than mocks where appropriate
- Focus on API boundaries and data transformations
- Test both happy paths and error conditions

**Tools:**
- pytest with fixtures for test data
- SQLite in-memory database for data layer tests
- pytest-mock for partial mocking when needed

**Example Test Cases:**
- User preference updates are correctly persisted to the database
- Recipe search correctly filters based on multiple criteria
- Meal plan generation integrates preferences and recommendations
- CLI commands correctly invoke and handle service responses

#### System Testing

**Purpose:** Verify the behavior of the complete application

**Scope:**
- End-to-end workflows
- Complete feature testing
- Performance testing
- Reliability testing

**Approach:**
- Script CLI interactions to simulate user workflows
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Measure performance metrics
- Test system recovery from errors

**Tools:**
- pytest for automated system tests
- Custom CLI testing harness
- Performance monitoring tools

**Example Test Cases:**
- Complete workflow: create profile, generate meal plan, view recipes
- System handles large recipe datasets efficiently
- Application recovers gracefully from database connection failures
- Performance remains acceptable under various load conditions

#### Acceptance Testing

**Purpose:** Verify the application meets user needs and expectations

**Scope:**
- User-facing functionality
- Usability testing
- AI recommendation quality assessment

**Approach:**
- Manual testing with predefined test scenarios
- Peer evaluation of CLI usability
- Subjective assessment of recommendation quality

**Tools:**
- Acceptance test checklists
- User feedback forms
- Recommendation quality rating system

**Example Test Cases:**
- CLI interface is intuitive and easy to navigate
- Generated meal plans meet specified dietary preferences
- Recipe instructions are clear and complete
- Cost estimates align with user budget constraints

### Test Environment

#### Development Environment
- Local developer machines
- Virtual environments for Python dependencies
- SQLite databases for testing
- Git branches for feature isolation

#### Continuous Integration Environment
- GitHub Actions or similar CI service
- Automated test runs on pull requests
- Linting and code quality checks
- Test coverage reporting

### Test Data Management

#### Test Data Sources
- Synthetic user profiles with diverse preferences
- Curated recipe dataset for predictable testing
- Generated test data for performance testing

#### Test Database Approach
- Use SQLite in-memory databases for unit and integration tests
- Reset database state between test runs
- Seed databases with known test data for reproducible results

### Testing Specific Components

#### AI Recommendation Testing

**Functional Testing:**
- Verify recommendation algorithms consider all user preferences
- Ensure meal plans adhere to dietary restrictions
- Confirm recommendations stay within budget constraints
- Validate recipe difficulty matches user skill level

**Quality Testing:**
- Assess diversity of meal recommendations
- Evaluate nutritional balance of meal plans
- Measure user satisfaction with recommendations
- Compare against baseline recommendation approaches

**Testing Approach:**
- Create test profiles with specific preference combinations
- Generate multiple meal plans for each profile
- Analyze results against expected outcomes
- Implement metrics for recommendation quality

#### Database and ORM Testing

**Test Focus:**
- Data persistence correctness
- Query performance and optimization
- Transaction handling and rollbacks
- Schema integrity and migrations

**Testing Approach:**
- Use database fixtures for consistent initial state
- Test CRUD operations for all entities
- Verify complex queries return expected results
- Test transaction boundaries and error handling

#### CLI Interface Testing

**Test Focus:**
- Command parsing and validation
- User feedback and error messages
- Command completion and help system
- Input/output formatting

**Testing Approach:**
- Script CLI interactions to test commands
- Verify output matches expected format
- Test handling of invalid inputs
- Assess help documentation completeness

### Test Execution Strategy

#### Continuous Testing

- Run regression tests before each release
- Automate regression testing where possible
- Update regression tests as new features are added

#### Test Prioritization
1. Critical path functionality tests
