# Project Charter: AI-Assisted Meal Planning Application

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-assisted meal planning application that generates personalized weekly meal plans and recipes based on user preferences. The application will initially be developed as a command-line interface (CLI) solution with local data persistence, with plans to evolve into a cloud-based web application and eventually mobile applications.

## Project Objectives
1. Create a functional MVP as a CLI application that generates personalized meal plans
2. Develop a robust user profile system that captures and stores user preferences
3. Implement AI-driven meal and recipe recommendations
4. Build a portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates software engineering skills
5. Establish a foundation that can be expanded to web and mobile platforms

## Success Criteria
1. Application successfully generates meal plans that align with user preferences
2. User profiles accurately capture and store preference information
3. Data persists locally in a database
4. System responds with appropriate recommendations based on input constraints
5. Code is well-documented and follows best practices
6. Application is completed before graduation

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- CLI-based application (MVP)
- Local database for user profiles and data persistence
- User profile management system
- AI-assisted meal planning functionality
- Recipe generation capability
- Support for various dietary preferences and restrictions

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Web application interface
- Mobile applications
- Cloud-based data storage
- Social features (sharing recipes, etc.)
- Integration with grocery delivery services
- Meal prep instructions or videos

## Stakeholders
- Developer (yourself) - Primary stakeholder
- Academic advisors/professors - Secondary stakeholders
- Potential employers (as portfolio project) - Indirect stakeholders

## Resource Requirements
- Development environment for Python
- Local database system
- AI/ML libraries and frameworks
- Testing frameworks
- Documentation tools

## Constraints
- Time: Must be completed before graduation
- Technical knowledge: May need to learn new frameworks or technologies
- Cost: Minimal budget for development tools or cloud services

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (MVP): 2-3 months
- Phase 2 (Web Application): 2-3 months after MVP
- Phase 3 (Mobile Applications): 3-4 months after web application

## Assumptions and Risks

### Assumptions
- Sufficient AI/ML libraries are available for recipe recommendation
- Local database will be adequate for MVP testing
- Python stack will be appropriate for all planned functionality

### Risks
- Learning curve for AI/ML integration may be steeper than expected
- Recipe data sources may be limited or difficult to access
- Scalability challenges when migrating to web/mobile platforms

## Approval
This project charter has been approved by Sarah Dowd on May 2, 2025.
