- [x] Create `README.md` and planning folder

### Week 2: Core CLI Framework
- [x] Set up CLI with `typer`
- [x] Add main menu and routing logic
- [x] Implement profile creation and storage in DB

### Week 3: GPT Integration
- [ ] Build prompt generator from user preferences
- [ ] Connect to OpenAI API using `openai` lib
- [ ] Display results in clean format in CLI

### Week 4: Meal Plan Storage + Viewing

- [ ] Add CLI view for past plans
- [ ] Enable plan regeneration

### Week 5: Error Handling + Polishing
- [ ] Add input validation, fallback messages
- [ ] Add color and layout polish using `rich`
- [ ] Create `.env.example` and usage docs

### Week 6: Testing + Wrap-Up

- [ ] Manual test user flow end-to-end
- [ ] Finalize `README.md` and project summary
